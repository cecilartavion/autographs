# `autographs` Contributor's Guide
So glad that you decided to contribute to this project! It's ongoing, and a lot of people need to use the things included here, so it's important that we leave behind a readable, well-kept codebase.

## Setup
Before editing any code, make sure to run `make setup`. This will install the necessary packages as well as set up a global symlink to develop the package. For more info about this process, take a look at `makefile`.

## Style
This project abides by the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) style guides. Please read these before contributing, as it's integral to the maintainability of this project that these standards are upheld.

## Pushing Code
We'll be using the same contribution model as [RunDMCMC](https://github.com/gerrymandr/RunDMCMC), wherein each contributing user has a fork of this repository and pushes changes to that fork. Then, when the user wants to make their code a part of the main repository, they open a [pull request](https://github.com/gerrymandr/autographs/pulls) and await approval of others (please request reviewers!). Otherwise, [follow this guide.](https://github.com/gerrymandr/RunDMCMC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
